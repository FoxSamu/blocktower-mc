      "Trouble Brewing has a little bit of everything. Some characters passively receive information, some need to take action to learn who is who, while some simply want to bait the Demon into attacking them. Both good and evil can gain the upper hand by making well-timed sacrifices. Trouble Brewing is a relatively straightforward Demon-hunt, but evil has a number of dastardly misinformation tricks up their sleeves, so the good players best question what they think they know if they hope to survive."

      "Clouds roll in over Ravenswood Bluff, engulfing this sleepy town and its superstitious inhabitants in foreboding shadow. Freshly-washed clothes dance eerily on lines strung between cottages. Chimneys cough plumes of smoke into the air. Exotic scents waft through cracks in windows and under doors, as hidden cauldrons lay bubbling. An unusually warm Autumn breeze wraps around vine-covered walls and whispers ominously to those brave enough to walk the cobbled streets.\n\nAnxious mothers call their children home from play, as thunder begins to clap on the horizon. If you listen more closely, however, noises stranger still can be heard echoing from the neighbouring forest. Under the watchful eye of a looming monastery, silhouetted figures skip from doorway to doorway. Those who can read the signs know there is... Trouble Brewing."
